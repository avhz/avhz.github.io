title: "Price Impact"
---

The bid-ask spread compensates for the price impact of buy and sell trades, which generally cause the price to rise and fall, respectively. 

Denote the midpoint price as:

$$
M := \frac{\text{ask}+\text{bid}}{2}
$$

The expected future value of $M$ is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[M_{\infty}] 
= \mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{\text{ask}+\text{bid}}{2} \right]
$$

In most markets, since one can assume that at least a small volume of trades are informed, the arrival of a buy trade (sell trade) should cause the expected value of $M$ to be greater than (less than) its current value. 

Mathematically, let the sign of the trade be:

$$
\delta = 
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{for a buy trade} \\
-1 & \text{for a sell trade} \\
\end{cases}
$$

We then have the expected long-term impact of a trade:

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\infty} := \mathbb{E}[\delta\cdot(M_{\infty} - M)]
$$

Since the arrival of a buy (sell) trade will cause $M$ to increase (decrease), we can see from the definition of $\delta$ that $\mathcal{R}_{\infty}>0$.
